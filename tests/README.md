## End to end tests with Puppeteer and Jest

## To run tests: 
### Clone the Repository
`git clone https://github.com/lei-diva/CodeOne.git`
### Initialize the project
`yarn` 
### Run the tests
`yarn test`

## Notes:
**Firefox tests are flaky due to deprecation of 'puppeteer-firefox'**
You can remove .js extension from firefox tests to run without them (decreasing run time due to less errors);
Run without firefox tests to decrease run time and errors, remove .js extension from firefox tests
